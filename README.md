🖐️ Hand Gesture Controlled Flappy Bird
A modern twist on the classic Flappy Bird game, controlled entirely by hand gestures using computer vision and machine learning!

🎮 Features
Hand Gesture Control: Use your hand movements to control the bird

Multiple Gesture Recognition:

✋ Raise 2+ fingers to flap

✌️ Peace sign to flap

👍 Thumbs up to flap

✊ Closed fist (no action)

Real-time Hand Tracking: Powered by Google's MediaPipe

Fallback Keyboard Control: Use SPACE key if camera is unavailable

Score System: Track your high scores

Smooth Graphics: 60 FPS gameplay with Pygame

Camera Feed: See your hand tracking in real-time

🎯 Demo
The game detects your hand gestures through your webcam and translates them into bird movements. Simply raise multiple fingers, make a peace sign, or give a thumbs up to make the bird flap!

📋 Requirements
Python: 3.9 or higher

Camera: Webcam for hand gesture detection

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

RAM: At least 4GB recommended

Processor: Modern multi-core processor

🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hand_gesture_flappy_bird
2. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Game

bash
python main.py
🎮 How to Play
Game Controls

Start the game: Press SPACE or make any recognized gesture

Flap the bird: Use any of these gestures:

✋ Open Hand: Raise 2 or more fingers

✌️ Peace Sign: Index and middle fingers up

👍 Thumbs Up: Thumb extended upward

Alternative: Use SPACE key as backup control

Pause: Press P during gameplay

Restart: Press R after game over

Quit: Press Q or ESC

Gesture Recognition Tips

Lighting: Ensure good lighting for better hand detection

Distance: Keep your hand 1-2 feet from the camera

Background: Plain backgrounds work best

Stability: Hold gestures clearly for 300ms minimum

Single Hand: Use one hand at a time for best results

🛠️ Technical Details
Technologies Used

Pygame: Game engine and graphics

OpenCV: Computer vision and camera handling

MediaPipe: Hand tracking and landmark detection

NumPy: Mathematical operations

Hand Landmark Detection

The game uses MediaPipe's 21-point hand landmark model:

Finger Detection: Compares fingertip vs. PIP joint positions

Gesture Classification: Analyzes landmark relationships

Real-time Processing: 30+ FPS hand tracking

Game Architecture

Modular Design: Separate modules for different functionality

State Management: Menu, Playing, Paused, Game Over states

Event-Driven: Handles both gesture and keyboard inputs

Collision Detection: Precise rectangle-based collision system

🎨 Customization
Game Settings

Edit src/config.py to customize:

Screen dimensions

Game physics (gravity, jump strength)

Colors and appearance

Gesture sensitivity

Camera settings

Adding New Gestures

Add gesture detection logic in hand_gesture_detector.py

Update gesture processing in game_engine.py

Add configuration in config.py

Example:

python
def detect_ok_sign(self, landmarks):
    # Add your gesture detection logic here
    return is_ok_gesture
🔧 Troubleshooting
Camera Issues

No camera detected: Check camera permissions

Poor detection: Improve lighting and background

Lag: Close other applications using camera

Performance Issues

Low FPS: Reduce camera resolution in config

High CPU usage: Lower MediaPipe confidence thresholds

Memory issues: Restart game periodically

Installation Problems

bash
# If MediaPipe installation fails
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install mediapipe --no-cache-dir

# If OpenCV issues occur
pip uninstall opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless
